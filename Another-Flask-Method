#Already Saved the amended “main.py” script which should look like this after the modification of the last part of the code:

from flask import Flask, escape, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    name = request.args.get("name", "World")
    return f'Hello, {escape(name)}!'
#ADDED PART OF THE CODE TO RUN THE PROGRAM IN A BETTER WAY....
if __name__=='__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
    
    
#Go back to your command/terminal window pointing to the amended script and enter the shorter version:
python3 main.py
